The Pantry Assistant

This is a recipe generator text-based program in Python. 

It is recommended to be run in the PyCharm IDE but it also functions correctly in more basic IDE's such as IDLE. 

The program has three core functions:
- Allowing a user to input ingredients they have on hand and outputing the recipes in their database that they are able to make as well as partial matches which require a few more ingredients
- Allowing the user to add new ingredients to their database
- Allowing the user to view all ingredients stored in their database and

The program functions with a corresponding JSON file for the recipe database which I have included. This provides a few base recipes and highlights how the file is formatted. To function correctly, please ensure it is saved in the same location as the python file on your device. 

Please note, my program does not require this file to run properly, if the JSON file cannot be located a new empty database will be created with the same name. !

When functioning correctly, when running the program the user will be greeted with the following title screen.
